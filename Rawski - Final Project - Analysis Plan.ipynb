    "# Section 2 - Data Collection Information\n",
    "I had to change the direction of my project because I wasn't able to find data for the original proposal. I decided to change to find data for the following question: How does the time of day that I listen to music affect the duration of the songs that I listen to? Instead of a Spotify user, I am a frequent listener of Amazon Music, so I went to the Amazon website and requested my data from them. I received the email to download my data a few days later. The structure of my data that I pulled from Amazon Music is a CSV file that contains the strings and integers of my listening data. This listening data covers all of the songs I have listened to and their duration that I listened to them from October 2024 to November 2025. It contains 8,928 rows and 12 columns, where each row represents one playback event recorded by Amazon Music. This file tells me the date and time of day that I listened to each song, the duration of the song itself, the duration that I listened to it, the title of each song, and the territory of where I was listening to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "I think that listening to songs during my daily commute causes me to not to finish more full songs because I have somewhere I need to be and pay attention rather than listening at night where I finish more full songs because I use it more as background noise to keep me focused to get things accomplished."

    "My data has 12 columns of sorted data information that covers 8,928 rows of songs that I listened to during the period of October 13, 2024 to November 11, 2025. A lot of my data is made up of strings that I will have to categorize and organize later. Of the numerical data that I have, I am able to calculate the mean, median, maximum, and minimum values for how long a song is supposed to be and how long I actually listen to that song. Through these calculations, I have learned that on average the songs I listen to are just over three minutes long and on average I listen to a song for about two and three quarter minutes. The track length statistics also show me that the shortest song in my data is 95 seconds long, the longest song in my data is 9 minutes and 78 seconds long, and the song in the middle of my data is about 3 minutes and 12 seconds long. The listen duration statistics tell me that the shortest amount of time I listened to a song was 0 seconds (probably due to skipping it right away), the longest amount of time I listened to a song was 24.2 minutes, and the song near the middle of my data I listened to for about 2 minutes 97 seconds. I am not sure what happened in the data that I was given from Amazon that it says I finished the song, but also listened to it for 24 minutes when it is only a 3.5 minute song. Dispite this one hiccup, I found it really valuable to see that I often did end up listening to an average 3 minute song all of the way through. The last bit of information that I was able to produce values for is the Reason for Stopped Playback column. By quantifying this data, it can show me exactly if I finished a song, if I stopped a song, if I skipped a song, or for some reason the system stopped the song. Quanifying this data from values into percentages also helps me to see how often I am really finishing a song, which almost 87 percent of the songs I play, I finish and is more than I originally thought. With all of this data quantified and created into statistics, it helps me to see more of the meaning behind it rather than the numbers or data on the screen and gets me further into testing the correlation between the data, which is the ultimate eventual goal of this project to see if my listening through songs is affected by the time of day I'm listening."

    "My plan for my analysis is see if there is a correlation between the Time of Day/Date column and the Reason for Stopped Playback column to determine if I do really listen to more songs fully at night due to a lack of interruptions like there are during my daily commute. What I plan to do is change the criteria of my Time of Day labels to reflect the time of my commute, then based on these time labels check to see what time I had the most TrackFinished labels in the Reason for Stopped Playback.

    "After going through these different forms of analysis, I really do have a better understanding of what my data is telling me. Once I had all of my statistics planned out from the Data in Hand, I had to go through the process of establishing multiple new columns to assist in my analysis. I had to convert the timestamp data from the Date column for each song into two different new columns one that just displays the hour and sorting the times into listening periods (between the night and my commuting hours, 8-11 and 3-6). With these two columns created, I had to use my data to create one more column that would help complete the other half of my analysis. I had to use the Listen Duration and Track Length to calculate the percentage of each song that was played. Once I created this calculation, I further included it as real percentages in my DataFrame. I also calculated the completion rate percentage for each listening period by filtering the songs with the label 'trackFinished' in the Reason for Stopped Playback column, which I later used for my visualizaitons. Creating these four new variables and columns helped me to actually get into my visualizations and analysis because it gave me the knowledge of what hour and time of day that I was listening to all of these songs and made the connection of how often and when I was actually listening to all of these songs completely. When it came to my visualizations, I decided on bar graphs because I needed something that would compare groups, values, or averages very clearly. I tried out some other visuals like box plots and scatter plots, but the issue with those is that they were not ideal for data with small or values in close proximity to one another like mine is. In my visualizations, I started out with the data that I was provided, putting the 'Track Length in Milliseconds' and 'Listen Duration in Minutes' into bar form histograms. This helped visualize that statistic that most of the tracks I listened to were an average of 3 minutes long and I listened to most of those tracks all of the way through for about 2-4 minutes. I then went into more analysis visualizations like the 'Playback Stop Reasons' in both their counts and percentages. The last one I went into, which I will likely end up using as my final graph for the Report is the 'Completion Rate by Listening Period' bar graph, which highlights the pattern of the percentage of songs I completed during my commute and my nightly listening. Overall, I think I have a good base for the analysis and visualizations that I will include in the final report."
