    "# Section 2 - Data Collection Information\n",
    "I had to change the direction of my project because I wasn't able to find data for the original proposal. I decided to change to find data for the following question: How does the time of day that I listen to music affect the duration of the songs that I listen to? Instead of a Spotify user, I am a frequent listener of Amazon Music, so I went to the Amazon website and requested my data from them. I received the email to download my data a few days later. The structure of my data that I pulled from Amazon Music is a CSV file that contains the strings and integers of my listening data. This listening data covers all of the songs I have listened to and their duration that I listened to them from October 2024 to November 2025. It contains 8,928 rows and 12 columns, where each row represents one playback event recorded by Amazon Music. This file tells me the date and time of day that I listened to each song, the duration of the song itself, the duration that I listened to it, the title of each song, and the territory of where I was listening to it."
